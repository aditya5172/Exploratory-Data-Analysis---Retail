# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Retail
I used Data Visualization to study the module ( which contains all the details such as profit/loss, sales, discount offered, location, etc., of all the retail shop across USA of a Superstore) to suggest where company can improve to increase the profit of the shop. With the help of Data Visualization I plotted graph for profit/loss and sales against discount offered to learn after 20% discount the company went for a loss no matter what amount of sale is made. I displayed top ten performing cities (with respect to profit). I drew graph for profit/loss and sales for each state which helped me to find the best performing state and worst performing. I also drew graph for profit/loss and sales for each product which helped me to find the most profit making product and least profit making product. Module: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
